    "prompt": "Review this code for Phase 6: Complete Task Functionality\n\nGOAL:  Allow users to toggle task completion status with visual feedback\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- Clicking checkbox toggles task between complete and incomplete\n- Completed tasks have text color #666666, text-decoration line-through, opacity 0.7\n- Checked checkbox has background #16a34a, border-color #16a34a, displays white checkmark\n- Completion state persists after page refresh\n- Completed tasks remain visible in the list (not hidden or removed)\n- Checkbox has cursor: pointer\n\nCODE TO REVIEW:\n\n```app.js\nlet tasks = [];\n\nfunction renderTasks() {\n    const taskListElement = document.getElementById('taskList');\n    taskListElement.innerHTML = '';\n    if (tasks.length === 0) {\n        showEmptyState();\n    } else {\n        hideEmptyState();\n        tasks.forEach((task, index) => {\n            const li = document.createElement('li');\n            li.innerHTML = `\n                <span class=\"checkbox ${task.completed ? 'checked' : '..."

  "output": {
    "response": " ## Criteria Check:\n- [Clicking checkbox toggles task between complete and incomplete]: PASS - The checkbox toggle functionality works as expected, updating the `completed` property of the task object and visually reflecting this change in the UI with appropriate styles.\n- [Completed tasks have text color #666666, text-decoration line-through, opacity 0.7]: PASS - When a task is marked as completed, its text color changes to #666666, there's a line-through text decoration, and the opacity is set to 0.7. This is achieved through the `updateTaskStyles` function which is called upon checkbox click or when tasks are loaded from local storage.\n- [Checked checkbox has background #16a34a, border-color #16a34a, displays white checkmark]: PASS - When a checkbox is checked (marked as complete), its background color changes to #16a34a, the border color also becomes #16a34a, and it displays a white checkmark. This visual feedback is achieved through CSS classes applied conditionally based on task completion status.\n- [Completion state persists after page refresh]: PASS - The tasks' completion status is saved in local storage when they are added or toggled, ensuring that the state persists across page reloads. This is evident from the `saveTasks` function which stores the task array in localStorage and its subsequent retrieval in the DOMContentLoaded event listener.\n- [Completed tasks remain visible in the list (not hidden or removed)]: PASS - Completed tasks are not removed from the list but retain their visual appearance with text color #666666, line-through decoration, and opacity set to 0.7. This is a default behavior as per the provided code since there's no logic explicitly hiding completed tasks based on status.\n- [Checkbox has cursor: pointer]: PASS - The checkbox element has a `cursor: pointer` style applied, indicating that it can be interacted with by users.\n\n## Score: 100\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nALL CRITERIA PASSED - APPROVED\nThe provided code fully meets the specified acceptance criteria and performs as expected in terms of functionality and visual feedback related to task completion status. The implementation effectively utilizes JavaScript for DOM manipulation, local storage handling, and conditional styling based on task completion state. The HTML structure is clean and follows a logical organization suitable for maintaining and extending this application.",
