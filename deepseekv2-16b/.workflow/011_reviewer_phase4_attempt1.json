    "prompt": "Review this code for Phase 4: Add Task Functionality\n\nGOAL:  Enable users to create new tasks via input field and button\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- Clicking Add button creates a new task with the input text\n- Pressing Enter in the input field creates a new task\n- Empty or whitespace-only input is ignored (no task created)\n- Input field clears after successfully adding a task\n- New tasks appear at the bottom of the list\n- New tasks are saved to localStorage immediately\n- Input field receives focus after adding a task\n\nCODE TO REVIEW:\n\n```app.js\nlet tasks = [];\n\nfunction renderTasks() {\n    const taskListElement = document.getElementById('taskList');\n    taskListElement.innerHTML = '';\n    tasks.forEach((task, index) => {\n        const li = document.createElement('li');\n        li.textContent = task;\n        li.addEventListener('click', () => {\n            if (confirm(`Are you sure you want to delete \"${task}\"?`)) {\n                tasks.splice(index, 1);\n                saveTasks();\n      ..."

  "output": {
    "response": " ## Criteria Check:\n- [Clicking Add button creates a new task with the input text]: PASS - The `addTask` function is triggered by both clicking the \"Add\" button and pressing Enter in the input field. It validates that the input text is not empty or whitespace, then adds it to the tasks array, saves the updated list, re-renders the tasks, and clears the input field.\n- [Pressing Enter in the input field creates a new task]: PASS - The event listener for `keypress` on the input field triggers the `addTask` function when the \"Enter\" key is pressed. This meets the criteria as described.\n- [Empty or whitespace-only input is ignored (no task created)]: PASS - Before adding a task, the code checks if the input text is not empty or only contains whitespace (`trim()`). If it's empty, no task is added, and this behavior aligns with the specification.\n- [Input field clears after successfully adding a task]: PASS - After adding a task, the input field is cleared using `inputField.value = ''`. This ensures that once a task is successfully created, the input box is reset for further entries.\n- [New tasks appear at the bottom of the list]: PASS - Each new task is appended to the end of the unordered list (`<ul>`), which means they are added to the DOM in sequence and thus appear at the bottom of the existing tasks.\n- [New tasks are saved to localStorage immediately]: PASS - The `tasks` array is updated both in memory (after adding a new task) and persisted in `localStorage` with each addition, ensuring that tasks persist even after page reloads.\n- [Input field receives focus after adding a task]: PASS - After successfully adding a task, the input field gains focus using `inputField.focus()`, fulfilling this requirement.\n\n## Score: 90\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nALL CRITERIA PASSED - APPROVED\nThe code effectively implements all the specified functionality and adheres to the given acceptance criteria. The implementation is complete, functional, and user-friendly as per the requirements provided.",
