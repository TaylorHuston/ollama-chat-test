    "response": " ## Criteria Check:\n- [Each task displays in a container with background #ffffff, border 1px solid #e0e0e0, border-radius 6px]: PASS - The tasks are displayed within `li` elements which have the specified styles applied.\n- [Task items have padding 12px 16px]: PASS - The padding is correctly set for each task item (`li` element).\n- [Space between task items is 8px]: PASS - There is a margin bottom of 8px between tasks, as expected.\n- [Each task shows: checkbox (left), text (middle, flex: 1), delete button (right)]: PASS - The layout includes a checkbox on the left, flexible space in the middle for the task text, and a delete button on the right.\n- [Checkbox is 20px \u00d7 20px with border 2px solid #e0e0e0, border-radius 4px]: PASS - The checkbox has the specified dimensions and style.\n- [Delete button has color #666666, padding 8px, border-radius 4px]: PASS - The delete button has the correct styling applied.\n- [Delete button shows \u00d7 symbol or trash icon]: PARTIAL FAIL - The delete button displays an '\u00d7' symbol, which is acceptable but consider using a more descriptive icon for clarity.\n- [Gap between task elements is 12px]: PASS - There is a gap of 12px between tasks as expected.\n- [Empty state message shows when task list is empty]: PASS - An empty state message appears when there are no tasks in the list.\n- [Empty state message hides when tasks exist]: PASS - The empty state message disappears when tasks are added to the list.\n- [Long task text wraps to multiple lines without overflow]: PARTIAL FAIL - Task text does not wrap and may cause overflow if too long. Consider adding `white-space: nowrap` or similar properties to handle this better.\n- [Task text displays special characters and emojis correctly (HTML escaped)]: PASS - The task text is displayed correctly, including special characters and emojis.\n\n## Score: 85\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nMost criteria are met, but there are a few areas that could be improved:\n- **Delete Button Icon**: While the '\u00d7' symbol is acceptable, consider using a more descriptive icon or text to indicate deletion functionality.\n- **Text Wrapping**: For better readability and to avoid overflow issues, ensure task texts wrap automatically if they exceed container width. You can achieve this by adding `white-space: nowrap` or similar properties where necessary.\n\nOverall, the code meets most of the requirements effectively. Addressing these minor points will enhance both functionality and user experience.",
