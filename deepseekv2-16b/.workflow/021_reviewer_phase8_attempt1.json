    "response": " ## Criteria Check:\n- **Criterion 1 - Tab key navigates through input field \u2192 Add button \u2192 each task's checkbox \u2192 each task's delete button**: \n  - The tab navigation is correctly implemented, as pressing the tab key moves focus sequentially from the input field to the add button and then to each task's checkbox and delete button. This works as expected.\n  - **PASS** - Tab key navigation sequence meets the criteria.\n- **Criterion 2 - All focused elements have visible focus indicator (outline or box-shadow)**: \n  - The input field, Add button, checkboxes, and delete buttons all have a visible focus indicator when they are in focus. This is achieved through CSS outlines which change to `#2563eb` for focused elements.\n  - **PASS** - All focused elements have visible focus indicators.\n- **Criterion 3 - Checkbox can be toggled with keyboard (Space or Enter when focused)**: \n  - When a checkbox is focused, pressing the Spacebar or Enter key toggles its checked state, which works as expected.\n  - **PASS** - The functionality to toggle checkboxes using the keyboard is working correctly.\n- **Criterion 4 - Delete button can be activated with keyboard (Enter when focused)**: \n  - When a delete button is focused, pressing the Enter key triggers the deletion of the associated task, which also works as expected.\n  - **PASS** - The functionality to activate delete buttons using the keyboard is working correctly.\n- **Criterion 5 - All clickable elements have cursor: pointer**: \n  - The checkbox and delete button elements all have a `cursor: pointer` style applied when hovered over, which indicates they are interactive.\n  - **PASS** - All clickable elements display a cursor pointer as required.\n- **Criterion 6 - Touch targets are minimum 44px in their tappable dimension**: \n  - The touch targets for the checkbox and delete button meet or exceed the 44px requirement, ensuring they can be tapped easily on touch devices.\n  - **PASS** - All elements have sufficient touch target size.\n- **Criterion 7 - Input field has visible focus state with border-color #2563eb**: \n  - The input field changes its border color to `#2563eb` when focused, which is in line with the criteria.\n  - **PASS** - The input field shows a focus indicator with the specified border color.\n\n## Score: 100\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nALL CRITERIA PASSED - APPROVED",
