    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- Task item has white background (#ffffff), 1px solid #e0e0e0 border, 6px border-radius - **FAIL** - The task item has a 6px border-radius but is missing the 1px solid #e0e0e0 border.\n- Task item has 12px 16px padding, flexbox layout with centered items, 12px gap - **PASS**\n- 8px vertical space between task items - **FAIL** - The task item margin-bottom is set to 8px, which is not consistent with the criteria of having 8px vertical space.\n- Checkbox is 20px \u00d7 20px with 2px solid #e0e0e0 border and 4px border-radius - **PASS**\n- Checked checkbox has #16a34a background and border, displays white checkmark - **FAIL** - The checked checkbox is missing a white checkmark.\n- Task text is 16px, font-weight 400, color #1a1a1a - **PASS**\n- Task text wraps properly for long content - **PASS**\n- Completed task text is #666666, has line-through, opacity 0.7 - **PASS**\n- Delete button has transparent background, #666666 color, 8px padding, 4px border-radius - **PASS**\n- Delete button hover shows #fee2e2 background and #dc2626 color - **PASS**\n- Interactive elements have minimum 44px touch target - **PASS** (checkbox and delete button already meet the requirement)\n\n## Score: 75\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\n1. The task item should have a 1px solid #e0e0e0 border as per the criteria.\n2. The vertical spacing between task items should be consistent with the criteria of having 8px vertical space, rather than the current margin-bottom of 8px on each task item.\n3. The checked checkbox is missing a white checkmark.",
