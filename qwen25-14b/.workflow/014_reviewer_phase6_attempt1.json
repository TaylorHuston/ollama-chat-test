    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- [renderTasks() clears existing task list and rebuilds from tasks array]: PASS - The `renderTasks` function clears the `taskList` innerHTML and then rebuilds it based on the `tasks` array.\n- [Each task item has data attribute with task ID for event handling]: PASS - Each task item has a `data-id` attribute set to the task's ID.\n- [Completed tasks have CSS class applied for strikethrough styling]: PASS - Completed tasks have the 'completed' class applied, which applies strikethrough styling via CSS.\n- [Empty state message is visible when tasks array is empty]: PASS - The `updateEmptyState` function ensures that the empty state message is displayed when there are no tasks.\n- [Empty state message is hidden when tasks array has items]: PASS - The `updateEmptyState` function also ensures that the empty state message is hidden when tasks are present.\n- [Special characters and HTML in task text display as text (not rendered as HTML)]: PASS - The `escapeHtml` function properly escapes special characters, ensuring they are displayed as text.\n- [Emojis display correctly in task text]: PASS - Emojis are displayed correctly because they are part of the Unicode character set.\n- [Long task text wraps to multiple lines without breaking layout]: PASS - The `.task-text` class uses `flex: 1`, allowing long text to wrap without breaking the layout.\n\n## Score: 100\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nALL CRITERIA PASSED - APPROVED",
