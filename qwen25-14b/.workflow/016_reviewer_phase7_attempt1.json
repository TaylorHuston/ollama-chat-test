  "output": {
    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- Clicking Add button creates a new task from input field value: PASS - The \"Add\" button correctly triggers the `addTask` function which adds a new task.\n- Pressing Enter key in input field creates a new task: PASS - The keypress event listener on the input field correctly calls `addTask` when the Enter key is pressed.\n- Empty or whitespace-only submissions are ignored (no blank tasks created): PASS - The `addTask` function checks if the trimmed task text is empty and returns early if it is, preventing blank tasks from being added.\n- Input field clears after successfully adding a task: PASS - After a task is successfully added, the input field is cleared by setting its value to an empty string.\n- New tasks appear at the bottom of the list: PASS - The `renderTasks` function appends new tasks to the `taskList`, ensuring they appear at the bottom.\n- Tasks are saved to localStorage immediately after adding: PASS - The `addTask` function calls `saveTasks` after adding a task, ensuring it is saved to localStorage.\n- Focus remains usable for adding another task after submission: PASS - After adding a task and clearing the input field, focus remains on the input field, allowing for easy addition of another task.\n\n## Score: 100\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nALL CRITERIA PASSED - APPROVED",
