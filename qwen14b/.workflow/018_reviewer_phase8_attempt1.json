    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- **Clicking checkbox toggles task between complete and incomplete**: PASS - The checkbox click event calls `toggleComplete`, which correctly toggles the completion state of the task.\n- **Completed tasks show strikethrough text with color #666666**: PASS - Completed tasks have the `.completed` class applied, which changes the text color to #666666 and applies a strikethrough.\n- **Completed tasks have opacity 0.7**: PASS - The `.completed` class also sets the opacity to 0.7 for completed tasks.\n- **Checkbox shows green (#16a34a) background with white checkmark when checked**: PASS - The checkbox has a green background and a white checkmark when checked, as defined in the CSS.\n- **Completion state is saved to localStorage immediately**: PASS - The `toggleComplete` function calls `saveTasks`, which saves the updated task list to localStorage.\n- **Completed tasks remain visible in the list (not hidden)**: PASS - Completed tasks are not hidden; they remain visible with the appropriate styling applied.\n\n## Score: 100\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nALL CRITERIA PASSED - APPROVED",
