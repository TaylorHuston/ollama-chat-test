    "prompt": "Review this code for Phase 8: Complete and Delete Task Functionality\n\nGOAL:  Implement task completion toggling and task deletion.\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- Clicking checkbox toggles task between complete and incomplete\n- Completed tasks remain visible in the list (not hidden)\n- Completion state is saved to localStorage immediately\n- Clicking delete button removes task from list\n- Deletion is immediate with no confirmation dialog\n- Deletion is saved to localStorage immediately\n- Deleted tasks cannot be recovered\n\nCODE TO REVIEW:\n\n```app.js\n// Constants\nconst STORAGE_KEY = 'todoAppTasks';\n\n// Data model and localStorage functions\nfunction generateUniqueId() {\n    return Date.now().toString(36) + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);\n}\n\nfunction createTask(text) {\n    return {\n        id: generateUniqueId(),\n        text: text,\n        completed: false,\n        createdAt: Date.now()\n    };\n}\n\nfunction saveTasks(tasks) {\n    try {\n        const tasksJson = JSON.stringify(tasks);\n        ..."

  "output": {
    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- Clicking checkbox toggles task between complete and incomplete: PASS - The `handleTaskListClick` function detects checkbox clicks and calls `toggleTaskComplete()`, which flips the `completed` boolean state\n- Completed tasks remain visible in the list (not hidden): PASS - The `renderTaskList` function renders all tasks without filtering by completion status. Completed tasks show with strikethrough styling but remain in the list\n- Completion state is saved to localStorage immediately: PASS - `toggleTaskComplete()` calls `saveTasks()` immediately after updating the task state, before re-rendering\n- Clicking delete button removes task from list: PASS - The `handleTaskListClick` function detects delete button clicks and calls `deleteTask()`, which filters out the task and re-renders\n- Deletion is immediate with no confirmation dialog: PASS - `deleteTask()` executes immediately without any confirmation prompt\n- Deletion is saved to localStorage immediately: PASS - `deleteTask()` calls `saveTasks()` immediately after filtering out the deleted task\n- Deleted tasks cannot be recovered: PASS - The task is permanently removed from the tasks array via filter operation with no undo mechanism\n\n## Score: 95\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nALL CRITERIA PASSED - APPROVED\n\nThe implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria. Task completion toggling works correctly with immediate localStorage persistence, completed tasks remain visible with appropriate visual styling, and deletion is immediate without confirmation. The code is clean, well-structured, and handles both click and keyboard interactions properly.",
