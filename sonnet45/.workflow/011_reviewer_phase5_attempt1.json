    "prompt": "Review this code for Phase 5: JavaScript Data Model and localStorage\n\nGOAL:  Implement the task data model and localStorage persistence layer.\n\nACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:\n- Tasks are stored in localStorage under a consistent key\n- Each task has: unique id, text content, completed boolean, creation timestamp\n- Tasks persist after page refresh\n- Tasks load correctly when page opens\n- If localStorage is unavailable, an error message is displayed to user\n- Tasks maintain their creation order when loaded\n\nCODE TO REVIEW:\n\n```app.js\n// Constants\nconst STORAGE_KEY = 'todoAppTasks';\n\n// Data model and localStorage functions\nfunction generateUniqueId() {\n    return Date.now().toString(36) + Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9);\n}\n\nfunction createTask(text) {\n    return {\n        id: generateUniqueId(),\n        text: text,\n        completed: false,\n        createdAt: Date.now()\n    };\n}\n\nfunction saveTasks(tasks) {\n    try {\n        const tasksJson = JSON.stringify(tasks);\n        localStorage.setI..."

    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- Tasks are stored in localStorage under a consistent key: PASS - Uses constant `STORAGE_KEY = 'todoAppTasks'`\n- Each task has: unique id, text content, completed boolean, creation timestamp: PASS - `createTask()` function creates objects with all required fields (id, text, completed, createdAt)\n- Tasks persist after page refresh: PASS - `saveTasks()` stores to localStorage, which persists across sessions\n- Tasks load correctly when page opens: PASS - `DOMContentLoaded` event calls `loadTasks()` and logs the loaded tasks\n- If localStorage is unavailable, an error message is displayed to user: PASS - `isLocalStorageAvailable()` checks availability and `showError()` displays message if unavailable\n- Tasks maintain their creation order when loaded: PASS - `loadTasks()` sorts tasks by `createdAt` timestamp before returning\n\n## Score: 95\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nALL CRITERIA PASSED - APPROVED\n\nThe implementation is solid and meets all acceptance criteria. The code includes:\n- Proper error handling with try-catch blocks\n- Clear separation of concerns (data model, localStorage, UI)\n- Defensive programming with `isLocalStorageAvailable()` check\n- Explicit sorting by creation timestamp to maintain order\n- User-friendly error messages\n\nMinor observation (not a criterion failure): The loaded tasks are only logged to console but not yet rendered to the UI. This is expected since Phase 5 focuses on the data model and persistence layer, and UI rendering will likely be implemented in subsequent phases.",
