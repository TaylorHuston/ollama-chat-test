    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- **Tab key navigates through input, Add button, checkboxes, and delete buttons**: PASS - The elements are focusable in the correct order.\n- **All focused elements show visible focus indicator with #2563eb color**: PASS - The outline color for focused elements is set to `var(--accent-color)`, which is `#2563eb`.\n- **Enter/Space activates focused buttons and checkboxes**: PASS - Event listeners are added to handle Enter and Space keys for button clicks.\n- **Focus order follows visual layout (top to bottom, left to right)**: PASS - The focusable elements follow the visual layout.\n- **No focus traps exist**: PASS - There are no unintended focus traps in the code.\n- **Screen reader can identify interactive elements (proper labels/roles)**: FAIL - While `aria-label` is used for some elements, there are no roles or additional attributes to ensure screen readers can fully understand the interactive elements.\n\n## Score: 85\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nTo pass the \"Screen reader can identify interactive elements (proper labels/roles)\" criterion, you should add appropriate ARIA roles and labels to all interactive elements. For example:\n\n- Ensure that checkboxes have `role=\"checkbox\"` and an appropriate `aria-checked` state.\n- Ensure that buttons have `role=\"button\"`.\n- Consider using `<label>` elements for checkboxes to improve accessibility.\n\nAdditionally, ensure that any dynamically created elements (like task items) also include these ARIA attributes.",
