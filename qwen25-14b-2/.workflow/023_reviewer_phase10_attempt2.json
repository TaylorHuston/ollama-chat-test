    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- **Tab key navigates through input, Add button, checkboxes, and delete buttons**: PASS - The `tabindex` attribute is not explicitly set, but all interactive elements are focusable by default.\n- **All focused elements show visible focus indicator with #2563eb color**: PASS - The CSS rule `outline-color: var(--accent-color);` applies the correct color to focus indicators for input fields and buttons.\n- **Enter/Space activates focused buttons and checkboxes**: PASS - Event listeners are added for both Space and Enter keys on interactive elements to activate them.\n- **Focus order follows visual layout (top to bottom, left to right)**: PASS - The default tab order matches the visual layout of the app.\n- **No focus traps exist**: PASS - There are no elements that would trap focus within the app.\n- **Screen reader can identify interactive elements (proper labels/roles)**: FAIL - The input field and buttons do not have explicit ARIA roles or labels. The `aria-label` attributes are present, but they should be more descriptive.\n\n## Score: 85\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nThe code meets most of the acceptance criteria, but there is one issue with screen reader accessibility. All interactive elements should have appropriate ARIA roles and labels to ensure that screen readers can correctly identify them. Specifically:\n\n- Ensure that all buttons have an `aria-label` or a more descriptive label.\n- Consider adding `role=\"button\"` to all button elements if necessary, although this is often not required as `<button>` elements already have the correct role by default.\n- For the input field, consider adding a more descriptive `aria-label` or using a `placeholder` that also serves as a label.\n\nFor example:\n```html\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"task-input\" placeholder=\"Enter task description\" aria-label=\"Task description\">\n<button onclick=\"addTask()\" aria-label=\"Add task\">Add</button>\n```\n\nAdditionally, for checkboxes and delete buttons rendered dynamically, ensure they also have appropriate ARIA attributes.",
