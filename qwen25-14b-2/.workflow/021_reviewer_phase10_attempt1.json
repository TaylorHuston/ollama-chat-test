    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- **Tab key navigates through input, Add button, checkboxes, and delete buttons**: PASS - The elements are focusable and can be navigated using the Tab key.\n- **All focused elements show visible focus indicator with #2563eb color**: PASS - The `outline-color` is set to `var(--accent-color)` which is `#2563eb`.\n- **Enter/Space activates focused buttons and checkboxes**: FAIL - The code does not handle spacebar activation for the Add button or delete buttons.\n- **Focus order follows visual layout (top to bottom, left to right)**: PASS - The focus order appears to follow the visual layout.\n- **No focus traps exist**: PASS - There are no indications of focus traps in the provided code.\n- **Screen reader can identify interactive elements (proper labels/roles)**: PASS - The input and buttons have appropriate `aria-label` attributes.\n\n## Score: 83\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nThe spacebar activation for focused buttons and checkboxes needs to be implemented. Specifically, you need to add an event listener that checks for the 'Space' key press and triggers the click event for the Add button and delete buttons when they are in focus.",
