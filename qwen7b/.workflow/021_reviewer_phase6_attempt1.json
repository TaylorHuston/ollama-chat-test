    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- **Tasks persist after page refresh**: PASS - Tasks are saved to localStorage and reloaded on page load.\n- **Tasks persist after closing and reopening browser**: PASS - Tasks are saved to localStorage, which persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.\n- **New tasks are saved immediately after creation**: PASS - When a new task is added, it is immediately saved to localStorage.\n- **Completion state changes are saved immediately**: PASS - Changes in the completion state of a task are immediately saved to localStorage.\n- **Deletions are saved immediately**: PASS - Deletions of tasks are immediately saved to localStorage.\n- **App loads correctly with empty localStorage (shows empty state)**: PASS - When localStorage is empty, the app displays the \"No tasks yet\" message.\n- **App handles corrupted localStorage gracefully (doesn't crash)**: PASS - The code includes error handling for parsing and saving tasks from/to localStorage. If there's an issue, it logs the error and continues running.\n- **If localStorage is unavailable, user sees an error message**: FAIL - There is no check for whether localStorage is available before trying to use it. This could lead to errors if localStorage is disabled or not supported.\n\n## Score: 78\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\nTo pass this criterion, you should add a check at the beginning of `loadTasks` and `saveTasks` functions to ensure that localStorage is available. You can do this by checking if `window.localStorage` is defined before attempting to use it. If it's not available, you can display an error message or handle the situation gracefully.",
