    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- [Task item has white background (#ffffff), 1px solid #e0e0e0 border, 6px border-radius]: **PASS** - The `.task-item` class has a white background, 1px solid #e0e0e0 border, and 6px border-radius.\n- [Task item has 12px 16px padding, flexbox layout with centered items, 12px gap]: **FAIL** - The `.task-item` class specifies 12px padding on both sides, but the task text is not centered within the checkbox and delete button. Additionally, there's no gap between the elements.\n- [8px vertical space between task items]: **PASS** - The `.task-item.completed` class has a margin-bottom of 8px to create the vertical spacing.\n- [Checkbox is 20px \u00d7 20px with 2px solid #e0e0e0 border and 4px border-radius]: **FAIL** - The checkbox dimensions are specified correctly, but the border-radius is incorrect. It should be `border-radius: 4px`.\n- [Checked checkbox has #16a34a background and border, displays white checkmark]: **PASS** - The `.task-item.completed .checkbox` class sets the correct background color and border for a checked checkbox.\n- [Task text is 16px, font-weight 400, color #1a1a1a]: **FAIL** - The task text should be styled with 16px font size, font-weight 400, and color #1a1a1a. However, there's no specific styling applied to the task text.\n- [Task text wraps properly for long content]: **PASS** - No specific styling is needed for this as HTML will handle line breaks by default.\n- [Completed task text is #666666, has line-through, opacity 0.7]: **PASS** - The `.task-item.completed .task-text` class applies the correct styles to completed task text.\n- [Delete button has transparent background, #666666 color, 8px padding, 4px border-radius]: **FAIL** - The delete button is styled correctly except for the border radius. It should be `border-radius: 4px`.\n- [Delete button hover shows #fee2e2 background and #dc2626 color]: **PASS** - The `.task-item .delete-btn:hover` class sets the correct background and text color on hover.\n- [Interactive elements have minimum 44px touch target]: **FAIL** - No specific styling is applied to ensure the touch targets meet the minimum size requirement.\n\n## Score: 75\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\n1. Ensure that the `.task-item` class has centered items using flexbox correctly.\n2. Set the border-radius of the checkbox to `4px`.\n3. Apply consistent styling to the task text (16px, font-weight 400, color #1a1a1a).\n4. Set the border-radius of the delete button to `4px` for consistency.\n5. Ensure that all interactive elements meet the minimum touch target size requirement of at least 44px.",
