    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- Long task text wraps to multiple lines without overflow **PASS** - The `white-space: normal` style in `.task-item .task-text` ensures that long text wraps to multiple lines.\n- HTML characters like `<script>` display as literal text **PASS** - Special characters are handled properly and displayed as literal text, ensuring they don't execute or render unexpectedly.\n- Emojis display correctly in tasks **PASS** - The code handles emojis without issue; they are displayed correctly.\n- List scrolls when tasks exceed viewport height **PASS** - The `overflow-y: auto` style on `ul#taskList` allows the list to scroll if it exceeds the viewport height.\n- App works on 320px wide viewport **FAIL** - The app does not handle a 320px wide viewport specifically. Elements and layout may not be optimized for such a small screen, leading to potential usability issues.\n- All buttons and checkboxes have minimum 44px touch target **PASS** - The `min-width: 44px` style on `.task-item .delete-btn` ensures that the delete button has a minimum touch target size. The checkbox also meets this criterion with a larger default size.\n- Tab key navigates through all interactive elements in logical order **FAIL** - There is no explicit focus management or tab order defined, so it's unclear if the tab key navigates through all interactive elements in the correct logical order. It's possible that elements are skipped or the order is incorrect.\n- Focused elements have visible focus indicator (uses #2563eb accent color) **PASS** - The input and delete button both have a custom focus style that uses the `#2563eb` accent color, ensuring focused elements stand out.\n- App remains responsive with 100+ tasks **FAIL** - There is no explicit performance optimization for handling a large number of tasks. Performance may degrade as the number of tasks increases.\n\n## Score: 75\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\n- **App does not handle 320px wide viewport specifically**: You need to test and optimize your app's layout and elements to ensure they are fully usable on smaller screens like a 320px wide viewport.\n  \n- **Tab key navigation order is unclear**: Add an explicit focus management strategy to ensure the tab key navigates through all interactive elements in a logical order. This can be done using `tabindex` attributes or JavaScript to set the focus order.\n\n- **App may not perform well with 100+ tasks**: Consider implementing performance optimizations such as virtual lists, lazy loading, or batch rendering to handle large numbers of tasks efficiently.",
