  "output": {
    "response": "## Criteria Check:\n- Long task text wraps to multiple lines without overflow - PASS (Long text in `task.text` is wrapped correctly.)\n- HTML characters like `<script>` display as literal text - PASS (`escapeHtml` function correctly escapes HTML entities)\n- Emojis display correctly in tasks - PASS (Emojis are displayed as literal text without breaking the layout)\n- List scrolls when tasks exceed viewport height - PASS (`ul#taskList` has `overflow-y: auto`)\n- App works on 320px wide viewport - FAIL (Content overflows and some elements are not visible) \n- All buttons and checkboxes have minimum 44px touch target - PASS (Buttons and checkboxes meet the required size)\n- Tab key navigates through all interactive elements in logical order - PASS (Tab key navigation is correct)\n- Focused elements have visible focus indicator (uses #2563eb accent color) - PASS (Focus indicator is visible with the correct color)\n- App remains responsive with 100+ tasks - FAIL (App becomes unresponsive when adding more than a few tasks)\n\n## Score: 75\n\n## Feedback for Developer:\n- The app needs to be optimized for smaller viewports, particularly at 320px. Consider using media queries and flexible layouts.\n- The app becomes unresponsive with an increasing number of tasks. Performance optimization is required to handle more than a few items without issues.",
